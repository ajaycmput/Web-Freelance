            <h3><strong> Overview </strong></h3>
            <p>
                I am excited to share with you my recent achievement of obtaining a Project Management Certificate. This valuable certification has equipped me with a strong foundation in project management principles and practices, enabling me to drive successful project outcomes.
                
                <p>
                Throughout my certificate program, I immersed myself in a comprehensive curriculum that covered various facets of project management. From project initiation and planning to execution, monitoring, and closure, I have gained expertise in every stage of the project lifecycle.
                </p>

                <p>
                The certificate program provided me with in-depth knowledge and practical skills in areas such as project scope management, time and cost management, quality assurance, risk assessment, and stakeholder engagement. I have honed my ability to effectively lead teams, allocate resources efficiently, mitigate risks, and ensure project deliverables align with organizational goals.
                </p>
